This new facility therefore is called  \"Azure DevOps Pipeline Integration\" module from within ServiceNow.  \nIt results in translating Change data from a chosen automated DevOps pipeline and injects this into Service Now change module as a Change Request record.  This negates under these conditions having to manually type and raise an IT Change request, thus allowing certain teams that are self contained to self manage their changes via their own pipelines, but will operationally feed their changes centrally into Change module in Service Now.  This operationally makes metrics, KPIs visible centrally to  support Operational running\/Service Management of our Services.\n\nThis new Service Offering depends on Service Portal (Service Now)",

      "Description":"- Teachers spend too much time resourcing and planning lessons. This increases their workload - especially for early career teachers, who often don't have the subject knowledge needed to plan and resource their lessons quickly.\n- Due to this time pressure, teachers often prioritise materials that are easy to use, easy to find and easy to adapt. This often compromises the quality of the lessons and the overall taught curriculum - as lessons become stand-alone lessons rather than part of a carefully planned sequence that helps build learner knowledge and skills progressively over a unit, year and Key Stage.\n- Teachers spend too much time on short term planning, planning for lessons that take place in the next day or week - rather than on long term or more strategic planning. Not only does this compromise the quality of teaching but it increases teacher stress levels and leads to the sense of overload that teachers increasingly report as driving them out of the profession.\n\nThe Curriculum Materials service aims to provide schools in England with high quality and coherent curriculum programmes (CCPs).

      "Description":"- Teachers spend too much time resourcing and planning lessons. This increases their workload - especially for early career teachers, who often don't have the subject knowledge needed to plan and resource their lessons quickly.\n- Due to this time pressure, teachers often prioritise materials that are easy to use, easy to find and easy to adapt. This often compromises the quality of the lessons and the overall taught curriculum - as lessons become stand-alone lessons rather than part of a carefully planned sequence that helps build learner knowledge and skills progressively over a unit, year and Key Stage.\n- Teachers spend too much time on short term planning, planning for lessons that take place in the next day or week - rather than on long term or more strategic planning. Not only does this compromise the quality of teaching but it increases teacher stress levels and leads to the sense of overload that teachers increasingly report as driving them out of the profession.\n\nThe Curriculum Materials service aims to provide schools in England with high quality and coherent curriculum programmes (CCPs). Carefully sequenced, these CCPs will improve the taught curriculum through robust and scientifically-backed curriculum design, as well as reduce workload and costs for schools.\n\nThe service will allow:\n- Centralised Complete Curriculum Programmes (CCPs) to be compared and selected by curriculum coordinators in schools\n-\tSchools will be able to choose the CCP that best meets their needs and objectives, and equip their teachers to curate lessons that deliver it.\n-\tTeachers will be able to get access to quality assured learning materials, grouped into units and associated with specific learning objectives.\n-\tThe clearer structure of the CCP will allow teachers to quickly find and select all relevant learning materials and plan their lessons in advance\n-\tCover teachers [and teaching assistants] will be able to quickly see all curated lessons and able to quickly step in and start teaching if required.\n\nUsers\nThis service will be available to all teachers, curriculum coordinators, school administrators and teaching assistants in England.

We believe that a single content hub for cyber security resources, offering a wide range of resources including guidance, best practice, case studies and eventually interactive tools will meet the needs of our target users (primary and secondary education settings in England).\nBy introducing an education.gov.uk hosted information service, targeted at Head Teachers, Governors and Digital Leaders, we can proactively support them in improving awareness of and the response to Cyber Security incidents and threats.   This proactive approach will not only increase the cyber knowledge of Senior Leaders in the school setting, but it will enhance safety of educational environments and prepare students and staff to thrive in an increasingly digital world.\n-\nThis service is in active development (end of Alpha).  There will be a limited private beta (<100 users).  The service is being developed in CIP (subscription number TBC).\n\nNB: Whilst this service is in development and the support wrapped is finalised, the service desk and primary support route have been set to DfE Service Desk.

One of the executive decisions back in 2019 from first DDGB was to setup a Data Governance Technology Platform to enable the data governance journey in DfE. The Platform comprising of Informatica Tool Set (AXON, EDC and IDQ) as technology stack was then installed in DfE Azure hosting (CIP) in 2020 led by Data Services team. \nThe prototypes were built to demonstrate value especially focusing on RoPA for DPO predominantly to address ICO Audit recommendation (GDPR Compliance) Eventually Business onboarding was kicked off for Data Ops, Apprenticeship Services (AS), Corporate Services (HR & Finance), ESFA and LDS 100. Now with the Market Place in AXON, DG Team is ready to roll out the platform to DfE Users and hence we need to enable  Service Now for the Production Platform.",

It will allow all of them to be kept abreast of progress, both in terms of availability of funds and including the development status. \n\nSignificant deviation may trigger a payment delay to reassess future funding, to manage risks or enhance monitoring of future delivery.",

The programme ran for seven years from 2014 and the current programme ended on 31 December 2020 in line with the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).\n\nFollowing approval to grant a contract extension to March 2022, DfE officials now need to conduct a procurement exercise to identify a supplier to ensure the remainder of the 2014-2020 Erasmus+ programme is delivered with effect from April 2022, including visa sponsorship (Tier 5) and that the UK Government meets its international legal obligations.\n\nThe NA has previously been able to issue sponsorship under Tier 5 to international students coming to the UK for Erasmus+ placements. The issue is that since the end of the transition period, the Tier 5 requirements now apply to all students from EU member states, which means a significant increase in the number of applications to be processed by the National Agency.\n\nThe programme is supported by two delivery partners which are British Council for Erasmus (residual activities from FY20-25) and Ecorys for T5 Visa Sponsorship.",

The service desk and network team are aware of this and can fix forward any issues. If there is a significant impact then the change can be backed out.\n\nWe need to get this change in place to flush out any problems as the PSN will be ceasing end of September.\n\nThis short call is to discuss any concerns in advance of CAB on 04\/09\/20.
